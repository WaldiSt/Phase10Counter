# Phase10Counter
Small App to keep track of your Phase10 game! Optimised for Phones and Tablets.

# Important
This was programmed as a side project. I am not any kind of professional developer or IT guy. This was just fun for me.
The Source Code is half english half german and probably cotains several war crimes since I did not put more effort into that, than it needed to fullfill the porpuse of tracking a Phase10 game.
